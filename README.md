# Hi, I'm Adriano 👋🏽 👨🏽‍💻

Ph.D. Candidate and M.Sc. in Applied Computing at the Brazilian Institute for Space Research (INPE), with a focus on Artificial Intelligence applied to Environmental and Space Sciences. My research involves computational methods for extracting information and forecasting storm severity characteristics, with a particular emphasis on lightning activity and heavy precipitation.

I have experience in modeling and systems development, working with both relational and non-relational databases, data collection and preprocessing, and the implementation of scalable data pipelines. I am also involved in DevOps and MLOps practices, supporting the deployment, monitoring, and automation of machine learning models in production environments.

Proficient in Python, R, Java, C/C++, SQL, JavaScript, and PHP, I have hands-on experience with a wide range of frameworks and libraries for data science, software development (frontend and backend), and workflow orchestration.

My main areas of interest include Computer Science, Data Science, and Artificial Intelligence, particularly their applications in Atmospheric Sciences.
